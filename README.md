## Features
This package provides two styles of views: *injected view* and *dock item*.

### Injected View
The injected view is placed on the top of the tree view, like Sublime Text.

To toggle the injected view, open the command palette `shift-ctrl(cmd)-p` and select `Tree View Panes: Toggle Injected View`, or disable it from the package settings.

### Dock Item
This package also provides a dock item independent to the tree view so that you can rearrange it freely.

To toggle the dock item, open the command palette `shift-ctrl(cmd)-p` and select `Tree View Panes: Toggle Dock Item`.
